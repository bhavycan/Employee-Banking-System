# HR-application

## Objective:

In this Project, is on the creating whole database model for online banking system and connect it with the C++ computer language. In this milestone I have executed my skill in DBS by creating the required table as i shown in my ER diagram. my project is based on Online Banking System .In which i add total of 9 table which reflects the characteristics of my database model.I used the C++ programming language and Oracle to develop a basic HR application. This assignment is designed to help students gain an understanding of how to create applications using C++ and Oracle databases.

For connecting our application with the Oracle SQL database I used the Oracle C++ Call Interface (OCCI) API which provides C++ applications access to data in an Oracle database. OCCI provides a library of standard database access and retrieval functions in the form of a dynamic run-time library (OCCI classes) that can be linked in a C++ application at run time
